					<h3>Brief Overview</h3>

			        	<p>The functionality of a WAV file is fairly simple when abstracting the specific data used. A WAV file is made by taking audio data, and wrapping it in RIFF formatting. The RIFF format is a tagged format, meaning that the data is contained in tags like HTML. Each tag, or container, contains data that tells the reader on an Operating System how to interpret the data, allowing the Operating System to determine what type of audio file it is. If it is a WAV file, the reader interprets the data using Linear Pulse Code Modulation, a type of method to digitally represent electrical signals, and thus audio is presented.</p>

			<h3>Format History</h3>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<h3>Who Created It?</h3>
					
					
					<p>WAV was created by IBM and Microsoft in 1991. WAV is an acronym for Waveform Audio. Waveform Audio being the data that is in the file, in the form of sinusoidal wave data.</p>	
					
				</div>
				<div class="col">
					<h3>Were There Similar Formats?</h3>
					
					<p>A similar format in the late 1900's was AIFF. AIFF had the same characteristics as WAV, except WAV uses LPCM instead of raw PCM which results in the ability to compress, and better handling of metadata. WAV is most commonly used for music in the professional world because of the high quality it provides, which prolongs the need for WAV by many years.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col">
					<h3>Is It Open Source?</h3>
					
					<p>WAV is open source, free, and can be manipulated as well as created by free software. Examples of software that could be used to play WAV files are: VLC, iTunes, QuickTime, Microsoft Groove Music, Winamp, Clementine, XMMS, and more.</p>

			<h3>Compression</h3>

							<h4>Does It Use Compression?</h4>
							
							<p>WAV typically does not use compression but can use compression if needed, which makes WAV very versatile.</p> 
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="row justify-content-end">
						<div class="col-5">
							<h4>Lossy or Lossless</h4>
							
							<p>WAV uses lossless formatting/compression, which makes quality of the audio high even after compression.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="row justify-content-start">
						<div class="col-5">
							<h4>Typical File Size</h4>
							
							<p>Since WAV compression depends on the format used to compress the audio, the best format for a WAV file would be a format that uses a high wave frequency with 16 bit (or higher) PCM. This results in a one minute WAV file being 1292 kB. When reducing the bits used by PCM by 8 bits (from 16 bits), the bitrate is reduced to half, thus reducing file size to half of the original size. In conclusion, WAV files are usually uncompressed, but when compressed, compression rates range anywhere from less than 5% to almost 60% depending on the format used for compression.</p>

					<h3>Similar formats & Advantages/Disadvantages</h3>
					
					<p>Similar formats to WAV are AIFF, FLAC, and APE. The main advantage that WAV provides is the ability to switch between compressed and uncompressed states; an ability that AIFF does not have. A situation that would put WAV at a disadvantage is when many audio files must be stored in a single location. In that case, the FLAC format would be much better since it is both a compressed and lossless format, meaning that the sound is the same and it takes up much less space. WAV is uncompressed, so even though it has a lossless format, compressing it would decrease sound quality depending on what is changed with the formatting. Overall, in terms of performance, WAV performs better than AIFF and APE because of the versatility it has as well as the popularity it maintains for having such a high quality, two traits which APE and AIFF do not have.</p>
